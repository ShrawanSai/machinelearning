Basic sklearn based ML problems
I'm doing this microsoft course on machine learning
till date they've been teaching basics of python
3 projects have been given and this is pretty intermediate stuff
they've just finished teacing numpy: only the basics
Linear regression was explained in detailed along with a bit of the math that is involved.
